module Invoicing
  # = Line item objects
  #
  # A line item is a single charge on an invoice or credit note, for example representing the sale
  # of one particular product. An invoice or credit note with a non-zero +total_amount+ must have at
  # least one +LineItem+ object associated with it, and its +total_amount+ must equal the sum of the
  # +net_amount+ and +tax_amount+ values of all +LineItem+ objects associated with it. For details
  # on invoices and credit notes, see the +LedgerItem+ module.
  #
  # Many of the important principles set down in the +LedgerItem+ module also apply for line items;
  # for example, once you have created a line item you generally shouldn't change it again. If you
  # need to correct a mistake, create an additional line item of the same type but a negative value.
  #
  # == Using +LineItem+
  #
  # In all likelihood you will have different types of charges which you need to make to your customers.
  # We store all those different types of line item in the same database table and use ActiveRecord's
  # single table inheritance to build a class hierarchy. You must create at least one line item
  # model class in your application, like this:
  #
  #   class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     acts_as_line_item
  #     belongs_to :ledger_item
  #   end
  #
  # You may then create a class hierarchy to suit your needs, for example:
  #
  #   class ProductSale < LineItem
  #     belongs_to :product
  #     
  #     def description
  #       product.title
  #     end
  #   end
  #   
  #   class ShippingCharges < LineItem
  #     def description
  #       "Shipping charges"
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # You may associate line items of any type with credit notes and invoices interchangeably. This
  # means, for example, that if you overcharge a customer for shipping, you can send them a credit
  # note with a +ShippingCharges+ line item, thus making it explicit what it is you are refunding.
  # On a credit note/refund the line item's +net_amount+ and +tax_amount+ should be negative.
  # +Payment+ records usually do not have any associated line items.
  #
  # == Required methods/database columns
  #
  # The following methods/database columns are <b>required</b> for +LineItem+ objects (you may give them
  # different names, but then you need to tell +acts_as_line_item+ about your custom names):
  #
  # +type+::
  #   String to store the class name, for ActiveRecord single table inheritance.
  #  
  # +ledger_item+::
  #   You should define an association <tt>belongs_to :ledger_item, ...</tt> which returns the
  #   +LedgerItem+ object (invoice/credit note) to which this line item belongs.
  #  
  # +ledger_item_id+::
  #   A foreign key of integer type, which stores the ID of the model object returned by the
  #   +ledger_item+ association.
  #
  # +net_amount+::
  #   A decimal column containing the monetary amount charged by this line item, not including tax.
  #   The value is typically positive on an invoice and negative on a credit note. The currency is
  #   not explicitly specified on the line item, but is taken to be the currency of the invoice or
  #   credit note to which it belongs. (This is deliberate, because you mustn't mix different
  #   currencies within one invoice.) See the documentation of the +CurrencyValue+ module for notes
  #   on suitable datatypes for monetary values. +acts_as_currency_value+ is automatically applied
  #   to this attribute.
  #   
  # +tax_amount+::
  #   A decimal column containing the monetary amount of tax which is added to +net_amount+ to
  #   obtain the total price. This may of course be zero if no tax applies; otherwise it should have
  #   the same sign as +net_amount+. +CurrencyValue+ applies as with +net_amount+. If you have
  #   several different taxes being applied, please check with your accountant. We suggest that you
  #   put VAT or sales tax in this +tax_amount+ column, and any other taxes (e.g. duty on alcohol or
  #   tobacco, or separate state/city taxes) in separate line items. If you are not obliged to pay
  #   tax, lucky you -- put zeroes in this column and await the day when you have enough business
  #   that you *do* have to pay tax.
  #
  # +description+::
  #   A method which returns a short string explaining to your user what this line item is for.
  #   Can be a database column but doesn't have to be.
  #
  # == Optional methods/database columns
  #
  # The following methods/database columns are <b>optional, but recommended</b> for +LineItem+ objects:
  #
  # +uuid+::
  #   A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID] string for this line item.
  #   It may seem unnecessary now, but may help you to keep track of your data later on as your system
  #   grows. If you have the +uuid+ gem installed and this column is present, a UUID is automatically
  #   generated when you create a new line item.
  #
  # +tax_point+::
  #   A datetime column which indicates the date on which the sale is made and/or the service is provided.
  #   It is related to the +issue_date+ on the associated invoice/credit note, but does not necessarily
  #   have the same value. The exact technicalities will vary by jurisdiction, but generally this is the
  #   point in time which determines into which month or which tax period you count a sale. The value may
  #   be the same as +created_at+ or +updated_at+, but not necessarily.
  #
  # +tax_rate_id+, +tax_rate+::
  #   +tax_rate_id+ is a foreign key of integer type, and +tax_rate+ is a +belongs_to+ association
  #   based on it. It refers to another model in your application which represents the tax rate
  #   applied to this line item. The tax rate model object should use +acts_as_tax_rate+. This
  #   attribute is necessary if you want tax calculations to be performed automatically.
  #
  # +price_id+, +price+::
  #   +price_id+ is a foreign key of integer type, and +price+ is a +belongs_to+ association based
  #   on it. It refers to another model in your application which represents the unit price (e.g. a
  #   reference to a the product, or to a particular price band of a service). The model object thus
  #   referred to should use +acts_as_price+. This attribute allows you to get better reports of how
  #   much you sold of what.
  #
  # +quantity+::
  #   A numeric (integer or decimal) type, saying how many units of a particular product or service
  #   this line item represents. Default is 1. Note that if you specify a +quantity+, the values for
  #   +net_amount+ and +tax_amount+ must be the cost of the given quantity as a whole; if you need
  #   to display the unit price, you can get it by dividing +net_amount+ by +quantity+, or by
  #   referring to the +price+ association.
  #
  # +creator_id+::
  #   The ID of the user whose action caused this line item to be created or updated. This can be useful
  #   for audit trail purposes, particularly if you allow multiple users of your application to act on
  #   behalf of the same customer organisation.
  #
  # +created_at+, +updated_at+::
  #   These standard datetime columns are also recommended.
  #
