== DESCRIPTION

This is a framework for generating and displaying invoices (ideal for
commercial Rails apps). It allows for flexible business logic; provides tools
for tax handling, commission calculation etc. It aims to be both
developer-friendly and accountant-friendly.

The Ruby Invoicing Framework is based on
{ActiveRecord}[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html].

Please see {the website}[http://ept.github.com/invoicing/] for an introduction
to using Invoicing, and check the
{API reference}[http://invoicing.rubyforge.org/doc/] for in-depth details.

If you're interested in contributing to the invoicing gem itself, please see the file
{HACKING.md}[http://github.com/ept/invoicing/blob/master/HACKING.md].
